{{!-- this page would be for displaying the contents of a single collection
        should have a button on it for either a link to a page with a form to add a new item
        or could have the form render directly on the page. Could be visible immediately
        or we could have it hidden and use client-side JS to make it visible with a button click
        or we could have the form pop up in a modal
        
        could also give the option to delete items directly from this page, or could leave that to the item-details
        probably should have an option to delete the entire collection as well, with some sort of confirmation--}}
